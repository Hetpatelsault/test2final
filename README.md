**i use ai apps to upgrade the style and also help to generate basic structure 
** and also use it for debuging and sometime solving the error in code 
**for example i use it to push the code in git hub because i did not do it on myself because it was showing error and i used chat gpt for solving the error (just letting you know sir)
**i use the refrence of the code on the other git repositories for the the basic idea or generating the idea.
**i update this code after using ai and try to understand it that is why i tried to make this page as simple as possible.
